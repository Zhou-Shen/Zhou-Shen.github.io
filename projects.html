        <p>Due to COVID-19, I lost my internship opportunity at Wayfair Inc. this summer. A lot of students face the same issue during this tough time. Thus, some of us founded a platform to connect students impacted by COVID-19 with remote research and internship opportunities. We developed the website - <a target= "_blank" href="http://www.internconn.com">InternConn Website</a> with Express.js framework. Our team outreached to more than 20 companies, 300+ students submitted applications, 10k visits in one month.</p>

        <p>I was very lucky to find another internship opportunity. At RezScore, I worked in full stack development team for developing and maintaining the Lead Generation management system. Our team designed and finished the front-end part of the user's dashboard page. Besides, we also implemented server-side back-end service using Django framework, along with PostgreSQL.</p>

      <div class = "projectp">
        <p>The main function of this system is to classify hyperspectral data with Deep Believe Network (DBN), Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The chosen database is Indian Pines database. The classification accuracy is 82%, 87% and 96% while applying DBN, SAE and CNN respectively.</p>

      <div class = "projectp">
        <p>In this project, I compared the performances of five classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Perceptron, LR) on unlabeled hand postures dataset. The dataset includes 5 types of hand postures from 12 users. The raw data form was preprocessed in three methods - standardization, normalization and PCA. The results show that the classifier SVM with 'rbf' kernal has the best performance, the accuracy is 96.4%.</p>

        <p>Since I learned front-end development and UI UX design, I always hope to use the skills I learned to create my own website. The process of developing a website from sketches was amazing, I really enjoyed it. In the future, I will invest more energy in this field.</p>
